# Friction-Measurements-Between-PLA-and-Silicone

In here we provide a dataset with measurements for friction between:

1. DragonSkin10-PLA
2. Smooth-on Sil 950-PLA

Used for the article submitted to Robotics and Automation Letters titled: "Development of a Dual Function Joint Modular Soft Actuator and its Evaluation using a Novel Dummy Finger Joint-Soft Actuator Complex Model"

Experimental Conditions are detailed on: ExperimentalConditions.md

Experimental Measurements of the Coefficient for 1. and 2. are included in: CoF-Measurements.csv

Graphs of the Average Transition of the Coefficient of Friction, Average Transition of the Coefficient of friction for each lap on the CAM circle and Average Coefficient of Friction for all experiments are included in Graphs.zip
