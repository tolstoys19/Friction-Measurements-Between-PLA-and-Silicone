# Friction-Measurements-Between-PLA-and-Silicone

In here we provide a dataset with measurements for friction between:

1. DragonSkin10-PLA
2. Smooth-on Sil 950-PLA

Experimental Conditions are detailed on: ExperimentalConditions.md

Experimental Measurements of the Coefficient for 1. and 2. are included in: CoF-Measurements.csv

Graphs of the Average Transition of the Coefficient of Friction, Average Transition of the Coefficient of friction for each lap on the CAM circle and Average Coefficient of Friction for all experiments are included in Graphs.zip
